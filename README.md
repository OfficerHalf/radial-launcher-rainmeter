# Radial Launcher
WIP

## The Goal:
Given any number of application launcher icons, arrange them radially around a central launcher. Hovering over the launcher (or clicking, depending on what options are set) would cause the launchers to slide out of the center to some point (a user set radius).

## Options
- AnimationMode: linear (default), boring (no animation), logarithmic, logreverse
- AnimationSpeed: 1 (default). Increase to speed up the animation, decrease to slow it down.
- RadialMode: radial (default), bottomright, bottomleft, topright, topleft
- Applications: #, the number of applications to display
- AppNExec: command each app launcher should run, where N is some number between 1 and total apps
- Radius: how far away the launchers should be
- More to come...
